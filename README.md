# salary_prediction
This is my first data science project! Here, I use the 'Salary Prediction Classification' dataset from Kaggle to  predict whether a person makes > $50K or &lt;= $50K a year. I use two classification algorithms: logistic regression and random forest. Using grid search algorithm to determine the best parameters for each model, I find that the random forest method gives the best accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC score of 82.3%.
